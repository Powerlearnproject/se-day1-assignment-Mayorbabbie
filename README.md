#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineering involves writing of codes, ensuring software quality by designing, developing and executing test plans and maintenance of software projects. 

importance of software engineering in the technology industry: 
1) Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
2) Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 1. The development of programming languages: The history of programming dates back to the early 19th century when mathematician Ada Lovelace created an algorithm for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, which is considered the first computer. the first actual programming language was developed in the 1950s, called FORTRAN (Formula Translation).
 
 2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s: Software engineering emerged in the late 1960s as a new engineering discipline concerned with all aspects pertaining to software production.
 
 3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s: The advent of structured programming began in the early 1970s and was due primarily to the efforts of Dijkstra (Dahl et al., 1972). They put forth the ideas of defining levels of abstraction and the definition of stepwise refinement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.
Examples 
1. Waterfall has a fixed timeline. The idea is that the start and finish of the project are already mapped out from the beginning.
2. Agile is a lot more flexible and accounts for experimenting with different directions. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

 1. Software Developer: Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software system using many different skills and tools.
 2. Quality Assurance Engineer: They oversee every phase of design, development, testing and delivery to verify if the product meets the quality standards and requirements.
 3. Project Manager: They are responsible for planning, scheduling and managing the delivery of software and web projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse).
    
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
    
  Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
    
Importance of Testing: reducing project risk, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Importance of Prompt engineering  in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Define Health?
Improved prompt: Define health according to WHO?

The improved prompt helps to get the definition of health according to WHO standard with irrelevant informations.
